# Thoughts about Sealife

## Sharks

Sharks are really scary when they are bigger than 3m.
Baby sharks are kind of cute, but they do bite.

## Sea Otters

Left handed Sea Otters are cuter than baby sharks.
If Hadrien could reinvent himself, he would be a Sea Otter in Vancouver.

## Killer Whales

They are Lachlan's favourite whale - and not because of the movie Free Willy.
Lachlan saw them at SeaWorld, now they are not allowed to be in shows.
